    "reasoning": "The document displays characteristics of a high-risk item due to the presence of two fundamentally distinct billing records on a single page. The top section is a printed slip with a Bill No. (5365), Date (23-10-2025), and a complete set of line items and financial totals (Subtotal: 1586.31, Discount: 56.31, Net Amount: 1530.00). The bottom section is a 'CASH BILL' form from 'SHREE PHARMACY', which includes handwritten entries for its Date (5.11.2025) and a single line item ('Thyrox 25mg' for 194.39). \n\nFor the 'header' section, the Bill ID (5365) and Date (2025-10-23) were extracted from the printed top slip as they were more structured and machine-readable. The 'vendor_name' ('SHREE PHARMACY') and 'document_title' ('CASH BILL') were derived from the pre-printed form at the bottom, as this section explicitly identifies the vendor and type of bill. This mixed sourcing of header information is a significant anomaly.\n\nAll line items from both sections were extracted and combined into a single list. For 'financials', the 'subtotal' represents the sum of all item amounts from both sections (1586.31 + 194.39 = 1780.70). The 'extracted_total' is calculated by subtracting the discount found in the top section (56.31) from this combined subtotal (1780.70 - 56.31 = 1724.39), assuming the discount applies to the aggregated total if they were to be combined. No explicit tax was identified. The disparate nature of these billing segments, their differing formats (printed vs. handwritten on a form), and the need to infer a consolidated total from two unrelated transactions significantly increase the fraud risk level.",
