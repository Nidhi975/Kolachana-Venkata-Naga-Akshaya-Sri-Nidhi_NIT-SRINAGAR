    "reasoning": "The document explicitly presents two separate 'CASH BILL' records on a single page, each with its own unique bill number and transaction date, implying two distinct transactions. A significant red flag is the presence of identical or highly similar pharmaceutical items ('Okamet-500' and 'Telma-20' / 'Talma 20mg') appearing on both bills with the same quantities but different prices. For example, 'Okamet-500' for 200 units is priced at 200.00 in the first bill and 228.00 in the second, and 'Telma-20' for 30 units is 110.00 while 'Talma 20mg' (likely the same item) for 30 units is 129.00. This strongly suggests potential duplicate claims, re-billing for the same items at different prices, or attempts at price manipulation. Furthermore, the visible differences in handwriting style between the two sections raise questions about who completed each part. The absence of clear vendor and patient details on either bill adds to the overall high-risk assessment, as it hinders verification of the transactions.",
