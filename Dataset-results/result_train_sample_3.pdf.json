This inherently reduces the verifiability and traceability of the transaction compared to digitally generated invoices. A specific red flag is the minor arithmetic discrepancy between the sum of the line item amounts (Rs. 429.94) and the handwritten extracted total (Rs. 430.00). While this could be a rounding error or simple mistake, it's a deviation from precise calculation. Additionally, the absence of a clear transaction date and recipient information further limits the ability to trace or verify the transaction, increasing the overall risk level.",
