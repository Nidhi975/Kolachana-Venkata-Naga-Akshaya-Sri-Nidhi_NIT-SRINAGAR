While the sum of the line items (109 + 160 + 231 = 500) perfectly matches the numerical 'TOTAL' of 500, the 'Amount In Words' clearly states 'Rs. Free Hundred Only'. The word 'Free' directly implies no cost, which is a stark contradiction to the stated numerical total of 500. This highly suspicious inconsistency, coupled with the entirely handwritten nature of the document and the lack of explicit vendor/recipient information, elevates the risk level to HIGH. There appears to be either a deliberate alteration or a grave error in recording the amount in words, which warrants further investigation.",
